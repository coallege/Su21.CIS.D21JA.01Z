# Introduce Yourself!

Post to this forum, by Wednesday June 30 to remain in the course. This is your "check in" post and must be completed to stay in the course.

Post a message to introduce yourself to the class! Put your name as the first line of the post. This will serve as the subject of the post!

Share whatever information you think might be interesting or relevant. For example, tell us about your background in software, hardware, etc. Let us know if this is your first time taking an online course. Let us know if you are interested in a specific career or education path (you never know where you'll make a possible job connection!). Consider sharing a fun fact about yourself that isn't related to our course at all!

This is also a good time to make sure you have a profile picture on your account! You can do this by clicking "Account" on the left menu, then "Profile," and then the pencil icon over the picture.

<p>Greetings, all. I hope everyone is enjoying the summer heat. I must say that personally, I enjoy it very much. I don't like the cold. I have next to no experience with hardware. As for software, I am just as inexperienced. The only experience I have is the few courses I took at De Anza. I have high aspirations; after landing my dream job at some grey, depressing cubicle, I plan to automate away most of the repetitive aspects of it so I can just twiddle my thumbs all day. Because of the advent of remote work, it's quite possible that I can hold several of these jobs at once due to my increased "productivity".</p>
