# module 3

Awake college student reluctantly sits down in chair and is surprised to see a
suspicious lack of homework assignments. Waits for second shoe to drop.

## instructions

- Read Chapter 2 of the book.
- Figure out how to set up a basic project I guess

## notes

- IA-32 is just 32 bit x86. Stands for Intel Architecture 32bit.
- Bus is a group of wires that transfers data
   - data bus: CPU <-> Memory
   - io bus: CPU <-> IO devices
   - control bus: controls actions of all things I guess
   - address bus: does address stuff
- Executing things is your usual
   - Fetch
   - Decode
   - Execute
   - Store
- Reading memory is
   - Put address of value on address bus
   - Change value of read pin???
   - Wait for "one clock cycle" for memory to respond
   - Copy data from data bus
   - You microbes, memory does not cost four clock cycles :scringe:. It costs like 200ish.
- Cache exists: L1, L2, L3
