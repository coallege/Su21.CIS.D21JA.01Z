This property makes the system both simpler to implement and capable of easily handling higher precision arithmetic. Also, zero has only a single representation, obviating the subtleties associated with negative zero, which exists in ones'-complement systems.</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2921032"><tbody><tr><td>Cole Gannon posted at 2021-06-30T00:35:53.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Unsigned is when you don't care about representing negative integers. It's good for stuff like array indices or counters that only go up. Signed integers include negative integers and there are two ways of doing it: one's complement and two's complement. Pretty much everything uses two's complement for representing signed integers because it's just-better. If ya don't need negative numbers, don't use signed integers.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2921417"><tbody><tr><td>conscious cattle posted at 2021-06-30T02:02:18.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>For the most part, your compiler will almost always use two's-complement for arithmetic variables so you won't have to worry about that issue when you are programming normally but if you ever do need to use it for something like a counter or a value that is strictly non-negative then it you could use an unsigned value. Just be careful when performing operations between signed and unsigned values as the compiler will cast them to one or the other which definitely can have an affect on how your program will run. Personally I wouldn't really use them except in certain cases as it could just make a program more complex than it needs to be and could be a hassle to debug later on.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2940129"><tbody><tr><td>conceptual catfish posted at 2021-07-05T06:38:31.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Are we able to do calculations with unsigned and signed integers?</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2922518"><tbody><tr><td>wasteful wildebeest posted at 2021-06-30T05:36:36.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><h2>Hexidecimal notation</h2><p>Can someone go further into detail how hexidecimals work?

Hexadecimals is like a numbering system used to simplify the binary numbering system. We use base 16 notation for it, 0-9 represents numbers 0-9 and 10-15 represents A-F. So each of the hex numbers represent 4 binary digits. Here's a chart that shows what each hexidecimal corresponds to in binary. You can memorize it easier by remembering that the binary digits correspond to a number. From right to left it goes 1, 2, 4, 8. When the digit is a 1, you add it. When the digit is 0, you don't do anything or just add 0. So, for example, if you had a binary digit of 0110, it would be 0+4+2+0=6. But if you had 1110, it would be 8+4+2+0=14, which corresponds to E in hexadecimal. I hope I didn't make it more confusing.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://deanza.instructure.com/users/155089/files/5502726/preview?verifier=YBnTrRIFRMNeLtrbnlADzWXX2rBe9yeIueIEciWo" alt="1_8j6O7L1gWQOqHyTUIEcEIA.png" data-api-endpoint="https://deanza.instructure.com/api/v1/users/155089/files/5502726" data-api-returntype="File"> &nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2936832"><tbody><tr><td>puzzled pony posted at 2021-07-04T04:49:08.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Here's a good video that intros binary and hexadecimal numbers:</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE" class="external youtubed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Understanding Binary, Hexadecimal, Decimal (Base-10), and more - YouTube</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL-LhaaMTTE" class="youtubed"><img src="/images/play_overlay.png" class="media_comment_thumbnail" style="background-image: url(//img.youtube.com/vi/ZL-LhaaMTTE/2.jpg)" alt=""></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 80px;" id="entry-2939303"><tbody><tr><td>abstract aardwolf posted at 2021-07-05T03:32:55.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Phaniteja,</p><p>Thanks for sharing the video.

Binary is base 2 (uses 0 and 1) and hexadecimal is base 16 (0 - 9 and A - F). The decimal system (the one we mostly use for day to day basis) is base 10 (0 - 9). Both hexadecimals and binary representations can be useful in different cases. Hexadecimals can simplify binary representation by a lot (more human friendly) and can be used for things like color values. You can also convert between the three representations (For example: from decimal to binary and then from binary to hexadecimal).&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2938071"><tbody><tr><td>implicit hoverfly posted at 2021-07-04T19:24:28.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>They are all a number system.

It is a method of expressing the number by adding six characters from A to F to ten numbers from 0 to 9. 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are used together like decimal numbers, and 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 are borrowed from the English alphabet capital letters A, B, C, D, E and F.

Although the table is a little arduous at first it will always give you the right answer. For smaller numbers after dealing with it a lot I have started to memorize/know some of them or numbers that are close to the desired value which makes it faster to determine the value.&nbsp;</p><p>To convert between hexadecimal and binary I chose to memorize some of the values and that way I can fill in the rest pretty easily. I would recommend memorizing that 0100 = 4 = 4, 1000 = 8 = 8, 1100 = 12 = C, and 1111 = 15 = F. When asked to convert start from the closest value that you have memorized to get the result. So if I was asked to find the binary representation of 10 or A, I recall that 1000 = 8 = 8. Since 10 is 2 greater than 8 the binary representation has to be 1010. If it is one greater than what you have memorized then make the rightmost 0 a 1, if its two greater make the penultimate 0 a 1, if it is three greater make the last two zeros into a 1, and you have memorized every fourth.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2938539"><tbody><tr><td>driving deer posted at 2021-07-04T22:41:36.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Naomi,</p><p>One method I learned from another CS class a while back for converting decimal numbers to binary which is different from what was taught in this class is subtracting powers of 2. For example, if you have 1010 1010<sub>2</sub>as the number in binary, you know that each bit in the number corresponds to a power of 2. The first 1 would correspond to 128, the second 32, the third 8, and the last 4. In decimal form, this number would be 172<sub>10</sub>so now let's work backwards. Each time you want to subtract the largest power of 2 until you reach 0. Make sure you keep track of the powers of 2 that you subtract. 172 - 128 = 44. 44 - 32 = 12. 12 - 8 = 4. 4 - 4 = 0. For each bit that corresponds with the power of 2 that you ended up subtracting, you would make that bit equal to 1. After doing so you should be able to get 1010 1010<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>If you want to convert from decimal to hexadecimal, you will need to use a different method. The reason the one above works is that binary numbers only have two possible values per bit, but a hexadecimal number has 16 possible values for each digit. In addition, calculating powers of 16 is more work, but you can just keep a table of these values when doin the work. One method that I find quite intuitive is similar to the one for binary numbers, but it involves division as well. Let's say you have the number 555<sub>10</sub>. If you divide it by the largest power of 16 that will result in a value that is at least 1, which is 256 in this case, then you would get 2.17. All you care about is the number ahead of the decimal, so 2 goes in the digit that corresponds with 256. Now, you need to subtract 256 x 2 from 555, which gives 43. The next largest power of 16 is 16, so you get 2.69 after the division and all you care about is the 2 in the front. After subtracting, you get 11. At this point, the smallest power is 1, so 11 is the number you care about, which corresponds to a B in hexadecimal. As a result, your final result is 22B<sub>16</sub>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2939739"><tbody><tr><td>thin tick posted at 2021-07-05T05:31:16.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Naomi,</p><p>This video helped me with decimal to hex:<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-hexadecimal.\" target="_blank" class="external" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-hexadecimal.</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a></p><p>And I used this one from decimal to binary:<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-binary" target="_blank" class="external" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-home/alg-intro-to-algebra/algebra-alternate-number-bases/v/decimal-to-binary</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2939803"><tbody><tr><td>surviving takin posted at 2021-07-05T05:45:50.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>In my opinion, the best way to do such conversions is to memorize the powers of 2 until the 10th.

We move down another power to&nbsp;<strong>64&nbsp;</strong>( 2<sup>6</sup>), same process,<strong>subtract 90 by 64</strong>, and get<strong>26</strong>. Moving down a power now to<strong>32&nbsp;</strong>( 2<sup>5</sup>), we realize this is larger than our current remaining value, so we move down another power to&nbsp;<strong>16&nbsp;</strong>( 2<sup>4</sup>), subtract, and we get<strong>10</strong>. Move down to<strong>8&nbsp;</strong>( 2<sup>3</sup>), subtract, and we're left with<strong>2</strong>.

Back in the 70s, the idea of working in groups of 8 took over (in the design of integrated circuits especially) and it helped in building the hardware by grouping the wires consistently from one piece to another. You are right about using more bits for being more efficient, but the convention of grouping bits into groups of 8 is much more logical.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2938285"><tbody><tr><td>entitled earwig posted at 2021-07-04T20:48:12.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>One of the reasons for grouping bits by 8 is also that the 2^8=256 possible values a byte can take is enough to cover all the ascii characters, and having one character take one byte of space is convenient.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2938487"><tbody><tr><td>ugliest trout posted at 2021-07-04T22:16:58.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Binary Addition</span></strong></p><p>From the textbook</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0</p><p>+</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1</p><p>= 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1</p><p>The part that I do not understand is base on the addition, 1 + 1 = 10, so at position 2, why it is equal to 0?</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2938498"><tbody><tr><td>consistent centipede posted at 2021-07-04T22:20:06.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Jimmy, I believe the 10 carries over, that's why there is a 1 on the 4th from the right.
