Python also uses <code>**</code> as well. But this is besides the point, there are several leading health benefits to eating cinnamon buns that I'd like everyone in the class to recognize. Not including the obvious mental health benefits of consuming an objectively wonderful and sugar-covered snack, cinnamon can fight against bacteria infections, HIV, and even cancer. Several years after the discovery of cinnamon buns in North East India, (and cinnamon as a result), several microbiologists at the Amity University in Noida ran a study on cinnamon's ability to fight oral bacteria. Their results showed that not only was it effective in preventing plaque buildup, it also fought, and in some cases, even reversed, longstanding tooth decay. In 2000, the Department of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, Kagoshima University in Japan concluded that cinnamon was the most effective at HIV type 1 and HIV type 2 inhibition out of 69 selected plant species used in traditional Indian folklore medicines. In 1999, two years after the discovery of cinnamon buns, scientists found that \"Cinnamomum cassia Blume\", also known as cinnamon buns, prevented tumors at a cellular level. The benefits of cinnamon cannot be understated. Naturally, these benefits carry over well to cinnamon buns. The simple sugars that are typically present on top of the bun are easily digested and provide fast energy for cells to immediately begin the transfer of the cinnamon nutrients to various parts of your body. Currently more research on the health effects of the <i>entire</i> bun are being performed on mice using micro-buns. Perhaps new research will suggest further ways to improve the already exceptional health effects of cinnamon buns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gupta C, Kumari A, Garg AP, Catanzaro R, Marotta F.

Continue to keep practicing to improve on future quizzes and exams.<br>Just remember to specify more on your question so others can better identify your issues and better help you.<br><br>In a general sense, conversions are common in the STEM field to help identify the numbers being used. For our homework, we are working with bases 2, 10, and 16; respectively binary, decimal, and hexadecimal. These are different ways to count. Decimal is engrained into us when using numbers, like how we used to count to 10 on our fingers. We can do the same with binary and hexadecimal. Binary is counted by 0 and 1's with 2^n. I recommend learning powers of 2s or just writing out decimals' value over binary numbers as they can be hard to read visually. Hex is n^16(i-1), where n is the hex number and i is the integer placement.&nbsp;<br><br>Get used to counting in binary and hex, as it's easier to convert them directly to each other, than thinking in decimal notation.</p>"},"replies":[]}]},{"id":"entry-2940318","entry":{"title":"relieved quail","time":"2021-07-05T07:20:28.000Z","msg":"<p>Hex numbers past 9</p>\n<p>A - 10</p>\n<p>B - 11</p>\n<p>C - 12</p>\n<p>D - 13</p>\n<p>E - 14</p>\n<p>F - 15</p>"},"replies":[{"id":"entry-2941606","entry":{"title":"Cole Gannon","time":"2021-07-06T01:44:27.000Z","msg":"<p>Hex numbers before 9</p>\n<p>1 - 1<br>3 - 3<br>4 - 4<br>5 - 5<br>6 - 6<br>2 - 2<br>7 - 7<br>8 - 8<br>9 - 9<br>O - 0</p>"},"replies":[]}]},{"id":"entry-2940506","entry":{"title":"professional pigeon","time":"2021-07-05T16:09:53.000Z","msg":"<p>is there anything the optional questions have in common?</p>"},"replies":[]},{"id":"entry-2942522","entry":{"title":"genuine gopher","time":"2021-07-06T06:22:34.000Z","msg":"<p>For question 14 b my decimal was negative how is this possible?</p>"},"replies":[]},{"id":"entry-2949438","entry":{"title":"civic bovid","time":"2021-07-08T06:57:50.000Z","msg":"<p><strong>Txt App:</strong></p>\n<p>I'm using the Sublime Text like suggestion but I don't know how do type exponential or make the number in lower line.
