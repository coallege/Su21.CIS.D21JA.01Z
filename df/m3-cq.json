Not 100% sure, but A can't happen physically because memory addresses and memory storage are two different things. They are not the same. The machine loads the \"address\", finds \"address\", and then goes to this address. B is due to how memory is handled, in this instance all memory is stack-based. Once the memory is loaded into the stack, it needs to check if it can go off the stack. Different memory systems have different limitations. For instance, a hard drive only spins one way so it needs to cycle again to go back in memory.</p>"},"replies":[]},{"entry":{"title":"spatial snipe","msg":"<p>This is certainly the limitation of Hardware. Since electrical signals and clock controls the processes, you can do only one action per clock cycle, read or store or add.&nbsp; All these low level instructions on how to read memory or how to store memory gives immense power to write the programs efficiently at the same time, it can be super lengthy.&nbsp; However as we move up to higher level languages, all these low level actions are abstracted and we never need to worry about those details, but at the cost we need to give into limitations of high-level languages like C, C++, Java etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;For your query about combining steps, it may be possible with redesigned hardware processors, but I am not sure if they will be feasible enough, otherwise all these improvements might have been done since the processor industry has come a long way.</p>"},"replies":[]},{"entry":{"title":"faithful firefly","msg":"If you combined the step of changing the read pin and writing out the hardware address, you might have a race condition where the read pin is changed before the address is changed, and the memory would fetch the wrong address. Because the smallest unit of machine time is the clock cycle, it might be infeasible to subdivide a single clock cycle into waiting for an address writing-out state and then completing a read pin changing state. Besides, as is mentioned in the book a lot of this lengthiness is mitigated by the fact that caching exists."},"replies":[]}]},{"entry":{"title":"shiny shark","msg":"<p>Supplemental Youtube video series on MIPS/ISA with detailed examples, execution flows, and memory management.
