Many times other people will be examining your code, and comments make it easy for them to understand what is going on. Usually in a high level programming language, programmers describe the purpose of their variables and write descriptions for their functions. Assembly language is going to be quite different but it has a lot of the same concepts. Especially if you are learning a new language like right now, comments will benefit you as you will better understand the code you are writing. I do not recall the professor saying anything about comments for the homework assignments requiring programming. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should not put excessive comments as sometimes the code itself is clear enough, and you will be wasting your time. You ultimately have to be the judge of what you should be commenting.</p>"},"replies":[]},{"id":"entry-2960432","entry":{"title":"conscious cattle","time":"2021-07-12T04:07:01.000Z","msg":"<p>For the most part you don't have to explain step by step as others have suggested but briefly commenting what certain references and what they do is extremely helpful as people viewing your code will be able to follow the program's execution and how variables are being changed throughout runtime.</p>"},"replies":[]},{"id":"entry-2961015","entry":{"title":"envious earwig","time":"2021-07-12T05:41:02.000Z","msg":"<p>Hi Michael,</p>\n<p>I think commenting is really useful so that others will be able to understand your code.
