Intel's AVX-512 works with 512-bit numbers on a 64 bit processor. Intel claims that this can help to increase throughput in such tasks as machine learning. Unfortunately, in many tasks that use floating point numbers increasing the precision beyond 64 bits is not particularly useful. Consider the fact that the some of the most precise physical measurements ever performed had an accuracy within a few parts in 10^13 (https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/497087/what-is-the-most-precise-physical-measurement-ever-performed), while 2^512 is in the ballpark is of 10^514! Furthermore, with more bits comes with slowdowns in processing. Using AVX-512 comes with a 25 percent slowdown in clock speed. 64 bits is a good compromise for representing many physical quantities such as time, but not so processor intensive that it harms performance.<br><br>Also note that high bit counts mean that you are typically using high-precision floating point numbers, as there aren't many tasks that require calculating integers that large. Nowadays, intensive floating point operations are generally left to the GPU.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2949956"><tbody><tr><td>consistent centipede posted at 2021-07-08T17:33:29.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>In the slides, Chapter 3 Slide 53, it talks about how MASM supports 64-bit programming, with some restrictions.

I thought that it was pretty helpful in addition to the textbook because it does not have as much reading and simplifies the information nicely. There was also one slide that had a nice template. I have not gone through the video lectures, so I unfortunately cannot comment on that.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2961614"><tbody><tr><td>easy dolphin posted at 2021-07-12T07:03:07.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Did you try doing the tutorials on your PC as shown in the text book for some concepts?

Then go back and take notes. This way you will be familiar with the content, and you can make more connections the next time you go in. I also found it helpful to look up questions on google I had as I was reading through the slides. Don't try to understand every detail, just get the main ideas at first. I would recommend reading the textbook pages afterwards, after you get the gist of the section through the PowerPoints.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2961217"><tbody><tr><td>breezy bird posted at 2021-07-12T06:08:25.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>I would like to know how important comments are for a person writing a program for someone?&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2961563"><tbody><tr><td>advanced anaconda posted at 2021-07-12T06:56:16.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Good comments/documentation makes the code easier to maintain in the future. Importance depends on who it's for. If someone else can understand your code without comments, that's fine. However, if your code gets looked at by multiple people, there's a chance that some people will not understand it so&nbsp;it might be a good idea to add some context. Hope this helps.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2966318"><tbody><tr><td>preliminary pelican posted at 2021-07-14T06:18:36.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Henry,</p><p>Comments are important for a person writing ANY program, whether for themselves or for others to read.&nbsp; If you write code without commenting your reasoning behind your steps, you may not remember your reasons behind the code if you revisit it 6 months later.&nbsp; Writing comments may seem cumbersome and extra work, but in the long run, the code will be more readable by yourself and others trying to understand the code and logic behind it.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2961272"><tbody><tr><td>ugliest trout posted at 2021-07-12T06:15:02.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">&nbsp;Standard Real Number Types</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It has shown three data types, which are short real, long real, and Extended-precision real.
