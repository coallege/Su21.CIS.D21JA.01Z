Would that increase speed &amp; performance?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>loose llama</td></tr><tr><td><p>Signed 64 bit numbers are HUGE and will probably be enough for quite some time.&nbsp; For example, Linux has been using a 32 bit Epoch time clock.&nbsp; This is the number of seconds since 1/1/1970.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this<a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>32 bit clock will overflow in 2038</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>.&nbsp; Of course, everything will switch over to 64 bit Epoch time to prevent catastrophic breakdown (though nuclear warhead launchers will likely still have old 32 bit clocks but nothing to worry about).&nbsp; So how long until the 64 bit timestamp wraps around and forces us to use 128 bit timestamps? &nbsp; Approximately 292 billion years from now.&nbsp; This is just one example of how large 64 bit values really are.</p><p>Obviously strings and BLOBs can be trillions of bytes so being able to manipulate them quickly is always useful.&nbsp; But as far numeric integer values, 64 bits is more than enough for typical purposes.&nbsp; Scientific computing is another issue altogether and there are cases were extremely high precision floating point numbers are very useful.&nbsp; But for gaming, internet and accounting?&nbsp; 64 bit will be useful for a very long time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>spatial snipe</td></tr><tr><td><p>Unless clock speed increases, speed of the processor cannot be increased as per my understanding and readings.&nbsp; Any processor above 64 bit processor is not yet commercially available. As explained in other replies to your post, currently there is plenty of room till we catchup to the limitations of 64 bit processor, but in my opinion we may soon see 128 bit processor as well.&nbsp; I may think like multiple cores on a processor, CPU may perform multiple partitions of bits and create parallelism, which I am not entirely sure if that is possible.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>faithful firefly</td></tr><tr><td>There are totally innovations for such programming! Intel's AVX-512 works with 512-bit numbers on a 64 bit processor. Intel claims that this can help to increase throughput in such tasks as machine learning. Unfortunately, in many tasks that use floating point numbers increasing the precision beyond 64 bits is not particularly useful. Consider the fact that the some of the most precise physical measurements ever performed had an accuracy within a few parts in 10^13 (https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/497087/what-is-the-most-precise-physical-measurement-ever-performed), while 2^512 is in the ballpark is of 10^514! Furthermore, with more bits comes with slowdowns in processing. Using AVX-512 comes with a 25 percent slowdown in clock speed. 64 bits is a good compromise for representing many physical quantities such as time, but not so processor intensive that it harms performance.<br><br>Also note that high bit counts mean that you are typically using high-precision floating point numbers, as there aren't many tasks that require calculating integers that large. Nowadays, intensive floating point operations are generally left to the GPU.</td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>consistent centipede</td></tr><tr><td><p>In the slides, Chapter 3 Slide 53, it talks about how MASM supports 64-bit programming, with some restrictions. In which scenarios would we use 64-bit instead of 32-bit? Will we be using 32 or 64 bit in this class?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>loose llama</td></tr><tr><td><p>This class is 32 bit only.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 80px;"><tbody><tr><td>professional pigeon</td></tr><tr><td><p>yeah I second that</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>Cole Gannon</td></tr><tr><td><p>Nowadays, you probably only wanna be using 64 bit because that's what architecture most desktop processors use. When you write these 32 bit applications to run on windows 10 64 bit, windows actually emulates a 32 bit environment with it's cursed Windows on Windows (WoW6432) thing. For this class I guess we're just gonna use 32 bit because it's what the book says to do.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>close buzzard</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Michael,</p><p>The name of this class has "x86" which is 32 bit only.</p><p>In the applications we use, making them 64 bit means the app can use more memory and not be restricted to 2-4 GB. There is still 32 bit for compatibility as 32 bit applications can run on a 64 bit processor / OS but not the other way around. 32 bit OSes are very rare nowadays though.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>agricultural ant</td></tr><tr><td><p>It really depends on what processor you are running your code, there are 32-bit CPUs and 64 bit CPUs. 64 bit is useful when running more intensive workloads. You can run 32-bit code on 64 bit, but you cannot run 64bit code on 32 bit. In this class, we will be using 32bit.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>spatial snipe</td></tr><tr><td><p>This is possible because only 32 bit can be used and the rest of the 32 bits can be ignored. The same will not be possible vice versa.&nbsp; x86 is old as per the slides, lectures and other resources, 32bit gives foundation of machine level which is not much different from 64 bit.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>genuine gopher</td></tr><tr><td><p>Reserved words</p><p>Why can't reserved words be used as identifies?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>surviving takin</td></tr><tr><td><p>For example in C++, if you name an integer variable "string" the compiler wouldn't be able to properly differentiate the actual function of a string, used to define multiple characters, and it being a variable name, therefore string is a reserved word. The same applies to assembly programming.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 80px;"><tbody><tr><td>Cole Gannon</td></tr><tr><td><p><code>string</code>is not a reserved word in C or C++. You can do<code>int string = 1</code>just fine. A good example of a reserved word in C++ would be<code>if</code>. As for the reason why reserved words exist in any language, that's just how the language works. The language uses those reserved words for it's own purposes. They're not user changable.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 80px;"><tbody><tr><td>driving deer</td></tr><tr><td><p>Adding on to what Cole said, I think that the reserved words are simply a part of the language's syntax. I think that another good example in C++ specifically, is doing something like&nbsp;<code>int int = 0;</code>. It simply doesn't make sense to create an int variable named int since int is already necessary for specifying the variable type. If you then tried to print out the variable by doing something like<code>cout &lt;&lt; int;</code>, then it would not make any sense.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>impressive hummingbird</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Haley, heres a list of most of the reserved words in MASM</p><p>https://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/coe/mudawar/coe205/manuals/MASMProgrGuide/D-ReservedWords.pdf</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>grumpy haddock</td></tr><tr><td><p>The reason reserved words can't be used as identifiers is that the compiler needs to be able to determine whether the code follows the syntax and rules of the language, and what code to generate. But if identifiers are used, the compiler may not be able to generate as you like. Additionally using reserved words are probably not descriptive enough to what the identifier is.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>professional pigeon</td></tr><tr><td><p>Well, if you did so, the compiler would have trouble differentiating which is which.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>skilled silkworm</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Haley,</p><p>Thanks for the post. Reserved words cannot be used as identifiers because these words are used for particular functions and cannot be used for anything else because they are reserved by the language whereas an i<span>dentifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item.</span></p><p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>entitled earwig</td></tr><tr><td><p>You can't use reserved words as identifiers because the compiler would not be able to understand if you're using a reserved word or identifying something. Thus, you'll have errors in your code and it would have trouble compiling.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>passive owl</td></tr><tr><td><p><span style="font-size: 18pt;">The character 'h' behind the code.</span></p><p>Example: str1 BYTE "Enter name: ",0Dh,0Ah&nbsp;</p><p>How can I understand the "h" that always behind the code "0D" &amp; "0A"?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>loose llama</td></tr><tr><td><p>The "h" suffix indicates that the value is hexadecimal.&nbsp; For example in C/C++ you would use 0x1234 for hex, but in MASM you would use 1234h.&nbsp; If your hex values starts with an alpha character, then you need to prefix the value with a zero.&nbsp; So for example in C/C++ you could write 0xABCD, but MASM requires 0ABCDh.&nbsp; MASM would assume that ABCDh must be a constant, label or variable name.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>overseas orca</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>MOV Mnemonic</strong></p><p>The book describes the MOV mnemonic, which moves a value from one register to another. For example, "MOV eax, ebx" would move the value in the ebx register to eax. Does this overwrite eax completely, or is the value that was previously in eax get stored somewhere in memory?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>supposed swordtail</td></tr><tr><td><p>This will overwrite eax completely. Since we did not manually specify to move the value of eax to another location, the value will be lost.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>financial fowl</td></tr><tr><td><p>So for any x86 register, there is a term called "scratch" that allows any function to overwrite another and can use it for anything, no questions asked. In this case, the value in the ebx register completely overwrites the eax register and there is no trace of the former value in eax.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>electoral dragon</td></tr><tr><td><p>Integer Literals</p><p>I had a question on the "encoded real"&nbsp; (r) radix. Is this the only way to store floats/numbers with a decimal point in assembly? And why is it classified as an integer literal if it is used to describe floats?</p><p>Thanks!</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>entitled earwig</td></tr><tr><td><p>The radix refers to the base of the number, such as hexadecimal (base 16), binary (base 2), etc. For example, typing in h at the end of the number (as the radix), lets you type in hexadecimal numbers. The radix is not necessarily used to describe floats, but to specify the base of the integer literal. Floats are described using real number literals, not integer literals.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;"><tbody><tr><td>enormous earthworm</td></tr><tr><td><p>Comments<br><br>How did ; become the indicator for a single line comment in Assembly but in other languages it marks the end of the line of code you are working on?</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;"><tbody><tr><td>conscious cattle</td></tr><tr><td>I think when the assembly language was first used, the keyboard had a limited character set and that forced the developers to use ; for single line comment in Assembly language.
