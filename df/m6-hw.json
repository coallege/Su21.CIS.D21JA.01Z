In this case, a runtime error will not occur when the code \"pop eax\" is digested. Even if there is no value to pop, it will not throw and error at you, it will just keep going since it is redundant. On the other hand, run time error occur when you are returning back to the code. The keyword \"ret\" tells the computer to start from that line after it goes off on its tangent of \"Ex2Sub.\" To answer your question, runtime errors will occur when the computer can't come back to its original code.</p>"

In the textbook, I read that the runtime stack and value that ESP points to are both impacted by both of these operators. How are the values on the stack impacted by these instructions? On question 16, I think that there is a runtime error since RET is called immediately after the return address is popped from the stack, but I am not confident with my answer.</p>"
