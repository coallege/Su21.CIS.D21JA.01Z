Many times other people will be examining your code, and comments make it easy for them to understand what is going on. Usually in a high level programming language, programmers describe the purpose of their variables and write descriptions for their functions. Assembly language is going to be quite different but it has a lot of the same concepts. Especially if you are learning a new language like right now, comments will benefit you as you will better understand the code you are writing. I do not recall the professor saying anything about comments for the homework assignments requiring programming. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should not put excessive comments as sometimes the code itself is clear enough, and you will be wasting your time. You ultimately have to be the judge of what you should be commenting.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2960432"><tbody><tr><td>conscious cattle posted at 2021-07-12T04:07:01.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>For the most part you don't have to explain step by step as others have suggested but briefly commenting what certain references and what they do is extremely helpful as people viewing your code will be able to follow the program's execution and how variables are being changed throughout runtime.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2961015"><tbody><tr><td>envious earwig posted at 2021-07-12T05:41:02.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Michael,</p><p>I think commenting is really useful so that others will be able to understand your code. However, it can be excessive, so I would comment on only important things. Instead of comments for every single line, you can write a summary about a chunk of code.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2961585"><tbody><tr><td>entitled earwig posted at 2021-07-12T06:58:24.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>Hi Michael,&nbsp;</p><p>According to my understanding, commenting is important because when a lot of people are working on the same code or when someone is reading your code, it may be difficult to understand parts of your code. So, to simplify that and make sure anyone reading your code understands it, you use comments. I think you should use comments where you think people might not be able to understand your code. You can also use comments in a way where they describe a whole method or a piece of code that is doing something specific.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 0px;" id="entry-2950299"><tbody><tr><td>genuine gopher posted at 2021-07-08T20:05:58.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>What is absolutely necessary to put in the code?</p><p>Do we have to put dwExitCode : DWORD?</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2953854"><tbody><tr><td>loose llama posted at 2021-07-09T17:39:51.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>The "dwExitCode: DWORD" is part of the ExitProcess function prototype:</p><pre>ExitProcess PROTO, dwExitCode:DWORD</pre><p>The equivalent C/C++ prototype would be something like:</p><pre><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-exitprocess" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>void ExitProcess( UINT uExitCode );</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui-icon ui-icon-extlink ui-icon-inline" title="Links to an external site."></span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a></pre><p>ExitProcess is a Windows API (essentially a library function) that is used to properly exit a Windows program.&nbsp; Calling the ExitProcess API tells Windows to that our process is finished and the dwExitCode is the result reported to the OS.&nbsp; Reporting the exit code as 0 means there was no error.&nbsp; It's like the "return 0;" at the end of a C/C++ program or "sys.exit(0)" in Python.&nbsp; We use this particular ExitProcess API because we run our program on Windows.&nbsp; It is part of the vast "Win32" API.</p><p>That said, you don't need to have the ExitProcess prototype declared in your program if you don't call it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2957340"><tbody><tr><td>Deleted by Cole Gannon on Jul 10 at 6:26pm posted at null</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr><td><table class="comment" style="margin-left: 40px;" id="entry-2957341"><tbody><tr><td>Cole Gannon posted at 2021-07-11T01:26:51.000Z</td></tr><tr><td><p>The argument name is not required, just the type.
