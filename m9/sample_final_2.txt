Part 1.
   1.
      Q: For any two integers n and m, ((nXOR m) XOR m) produces n.
      A: True.
   2.
      Q: The TEST instruction always alters the destination operand.
      A: False.
   3.
      Q: XORing an operand with 1 always causes the Zero flag to be set.
      A: False. 0^1 = 1
   4.
      Q: ANDing an operand with 1 sets the zero flag if the operand was
         originally an even number.
      A: True.
   5.
      Q: The Parity flag indicates whether the lowest byte of a destination
         operand has an even number of 1 bits.
      A: True.
   6.
      Q: The XOR instruction inverts each bit in a destination operand.
      A: False.
   7.
      Q: The JBE instruction is used when comparing unsigned integers.
      A: True.
   8.
      Q: The OR instruction can be used to find the intersection of two
         bit-mapped sets.
      A: False.
   9.
      Q: With unsigned operands, the CMP instruction sets the Carry flag when
         the destination operand is less than the sourceoperand.
      A: True.
   10.
      Q: With signed operands, the CMP instruction makes the Sign flag equal to
         the Overflow flag when the destination operand is less than the source
         operand.
      A: False.
   11.
      Q: The MUL instruction sets the Overflow flag if the upper half of the
         product is not equal to zero.
      A: True.
   12.
      Q: When the MUL BX instruction executes, the 32-bit product ends into the
         EAX register.
      A: False.
   13.
      Q: The binary value of AL after the following instructions have executed
         is 00001101.
         mov al,01101011b
         shr al,2
      A: False.
   14.
      Q: The binary value of AL after the following instructions have executed
         is 11101101.
         mov al, 01101011b
         rol al,2
      A: False.
   15.
      Q: The hexadecimal values of DX and AX after the following instructions
         have executed are DX=0005 and AX=0000.
         mov dx,5000h
         mov ax,20h
         mul dx
      A: False.
   16.
      Q: The following is a valid LOCAL declaration?
         LOCAL index:DWORD
      A: Yes.
   17.
      Q: In 32-bit programs, ADDR and OFFSET return the same value.
      A: True.
   18.
      Q: An indirect operand such as [eax + edi] can be passed to the INVOKE
         directive.
      A: True.
   19.
      Q: The C calling convention requires the calling program to reset the
         stack pointer after the subroutine has returned.
      A: True.
   20.
      Q: When a subroutine argument is passed by value, the calling program
         pushes the argument's address on the stack.
      A: False. This behavior would only happen if the argument was passed by
         reference.
