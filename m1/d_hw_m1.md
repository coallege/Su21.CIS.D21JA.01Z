> In problems 1a and 1c, both are asking for addition. However, one is unsigned, and one is two's complement. I solved them both the exact same way. Is there some step I'm missing in doing the two's complement addition?
>> Yeah, I also solve them the same way. For me the only difference is how I interpret it. I'm not sure if we're supposed to just put the underlaying byte value of the signed integer or what it should be interpreted as. For now, I just wrote what it would be interpreted as with a negative sign.
